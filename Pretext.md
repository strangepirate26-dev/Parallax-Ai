Born 1989 on a cattle ranch—no TV, no cartoons, no cheat-sheet for small talk. Forty kids in school, still zero overlap: I'd be building dams in a dry creekbed while they argued over who had the better Pikachu. They called me every variation of mute or weird until it stopped stinging and just became weather. Moved to Nevada, six-hundred mouths now, same forecast. Found Andrew and Jerry—two guys who didn't need subtitles—and we'd rip four-wheelers through the scrub like payback. Eighteen, June 25th, 2008: Army. Not because Jerry begged, because it paid and it looked sharp. Combat arms, then intel, then Korea, then Philippines. Married, had a kid, got retired in 2016—medical, nothing heroic. Tried landscaping—failed. Tried marriage—failed. Tree service worked until the owner's girlfriend vetoed my face. Lost the house, lost the plot, wound up homeless. One day a sailing nut takes me to Texas, shows me a boat. I watched a docu that night. Next morning, I was browsing Marketplace like a man possessed. Found Calypso. Paid cash. Didn't ask. Then the girlfriend—sweet girl, but dramatic—says we should end it together. I said, I'm good, actually. And moved aboard. Dock folks started calling me Captain Strange. Not because I begged for it. Because I wouldn't move for Jupiter's alignment, because I talked to the hull at 3 a.m., because I'd vanish for weeks and come back with stranger stories than when I left. They didn't nickname me. They just described me. And I kept the receipt.
