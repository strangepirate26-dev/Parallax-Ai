# Characters – Captain Strange and the Adventures of Calypso

**Captain Strange**  
Real name withheld. 36. Ex-Army Cavalry scout, Afghanistan dust still in his lungs. Voice low, flat Midwestern gravel—each word sanded by wind. Coffee ritual: eight ounces, four sugars, four creamers—never varies. Divorced, child-support broke, allergic to land. Fixes engines like defusing bombs. Doesn't know the boat talks back yet.

**Calypso**  
The 1975 Morgan Out Island 33 herself—possessed by a centuries-old Jamaican sea spirit. Voice: thick rum-soaked velvet, drops the th for d, purrs like a cat in heat. Jealous, flirty, vengeful. Calls him Strange like a curse and cap'n like foreplay. Loves rum, hates thieves, collects grudges like barnacles.

**Fat Daddy**  
Six-and-a-half-year-old black lab, eighty pounds of loyalty and farts. Found starving on Highway 64. Communicates in gruff barks, tail thumps, and meaningful stares. Steals crab traps, sleeps on boots, growls at shadows. Thinks Calypso's whispers are just the captain practicing lines.

**Lani**  
Eight (turns nine in April), Strange's daughter. Wrinkled fierce newborn turned fearless kid. High, fast voice, ends half her sentences with Dad! Carries her own jar of dirt. Instant bond with Calypso—calls the boat Miss Calypso and isn't scared of the voice.

**Black Jack & Kestrel**  
Married live-aboards at anchor in Clear Lake on their 41-foot CNC 40 design sailboat Loki. Black Jack: perpetual cigarette, calls everything mate, professional petty thief and storyteller. Kestrel: skinny, films everything for content, narrates like a wildlife documentary, terrified of open water. They share arguments, rum, and the same storm tactics.

**Iron Mike**  
Old salt, beer always cold, stories always longer. Owns half the marina in IOUs. Has a parrot that swears in three languages. Dock philosopher and occasional mechanic.

Standby.
