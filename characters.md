Characters – Captain Strange and the Adventures of Calypso Captain Strange Real name: redacted. 36. Ex-Army Cavalry scout, one tour Afghanistan. Low, flat Midwestern voice, speaks like every sentence is rationed. Coffee ritual: eight ounces, four sugars, four creamers—never varies. Divorced, child-support broke, allergic to land. Fixes engines like defusing bombs. Doesn't know the boat talks back yet. Calypso The 1975 Morgan Out Island 33 herself—possessed by a centuries-old Jamaican sea spirit. Voice: thick rum-soaked velvet, drops the th for d, purrs like a cat in heat. Jealous, flirty, vengeful. Calls him Strange like a curse and cap'n like foreplay. Loves rum, hates thieves, collects grudges like barnacles. Fat Daddy Six-and-a-half-year-old black lab, eighty pounds of loyalty and farts. Found starving on Highway 64. Communicates in gruff barks, tail thumps, and meaningful stares. Steals crab traps, sleeps on boots, growls at shadows. Thinks Calypso's whispers are just the captain practicing lines. Lani Eight (almost nine), Strange's daughter. Wrinkled fierce newborn turned fearless kid. High, fast voice, ends half her sentences with Dad! Carries her own jar of dirt. Instant bond with Calypso—calls the boat Miss Calypso and isn't scared of the voice. Black Jack Dock rat, perpetual cigarette, calls everything mate. Professional petty thief, professional beer drinker. Owns a rusty Chris-Craft that never leaves the slip. Kestrel Skinny live-aboard with a camera and a mouth. Films everything for content, narrates like a wildlife documentary. Secretly terrified of open water. Iron Mike Old salt, beer always cold, stories always longer. Owns half the marina in IOUs. Has a parrot that swears in three languages. Janet Sold Strange the leaking Subaru for a case of beer and a handshake. Still feels bad about it. Dockmaster Unnamed, spits tobacco, hates everyone equally. Keeps a shotgun behind the counter for raccoons. Beaujolais  
1978 Irwin 38 Mark II center cockpit. Teak caprail worn smooth, stainless bow roller bent like a question mark. Slips starboard of Rule 11, opposite the Cringeanier circus. Hull still whispers the name, even if the O got sanded off years ago.

Captain Joe Morgan  
54. Ex-Coast Guard, drinks Captain Morgan spiced rum like it's holy water and 1995 never ended. Full beard because shaving is for civilians and landlubbers. Calls his first mate Sin because it's half her name and twice her vice. Fixes radars with duct tape, profanity, and prayer. Thinks Cringeanier is weird but harmless as barnacles. Thinks Strange is one good squall away from genius.

Cinda "Sin" Morgan  
52. First mate, bar-tab queen, runs Beaujolais like a pirate queen runs a tavern. Voice like smoked bourbon—rough, warm, swears in dockworker Spanish. Keeps a 12-gauge pump under the v-berth for raccoons, thieves, and bad decisions. Chooses the music, pours the sundowners, steers when Morgan's too deep in his bottle. Rum at sunset, engine checks at noon, no arguments.

Ship's rule: Morgan steers and nods. Sin runs the rest.
